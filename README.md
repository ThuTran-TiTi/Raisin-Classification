# Raisin Classification Using Machine Learning

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Raisin Classification project repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification system to differentiate between two varieties of raisins: Kecimen and Besni. The repository contains the dataset, code, and documentation necessary to reproduce the results and further explore the classification model.

## Dataset:
The dataset consists of 900 images of raisin grains, equally divided between the Kecimen and Besni varieties. Each image has been processed to extract seven morphological features, forming the basis for model training and evaluation.

## Code:
The R code used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is available in the `Final_Raisin_Rmarkdown.pdf`. The main script, `Final_Raisin.Rmd`, contains the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, utility functions for data visualization and performance metrics are provided in separate files.

## Methods Used
- Multiple Logistic regression
- Decision Tree, Random Forest classification algorithms
- R programming language

## Results:
Upon running the code, you will obtain detailed results and evaluation metrics for each classification model (Logistic Regression, decision trees, and random forest). These results provide insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm in distinguishing between Kecimen and Besni raisin grains.

## Contributing:
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to extend the functionality, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
